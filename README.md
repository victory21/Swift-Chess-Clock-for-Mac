# Swift-Chess-Clock-for-Mac
still a work in progress and prolly will be for sometime

it is supose to be like a chess clock that has two timers, each on one half of the screen. There should be three buttons, one pause, one switch, and one reset. There should be three timers, one left, one right and one for the total time past.
